Never be an insincere friend, never be manipulative, one day you will be discovered and lose everything
A bad friend secretly plots your downfall
Keep quiet and the enemy will reveal himself
Would a robber break in your home at night beating drums? Nope. This is how those who want to take advantage of your life come: Full of smiles and promising sincere friendship
Nothing exists, all is shadow and illusion
If you believe that the world is conspiring against you, it will just do that.
Don't tell your friend you are fighting with your wife, it gives him pleasure
Hoarding can never end, for the heart of man always covets for more, its raging appetites can only be quenched by the heavy sands of the grave.
The wolf is not the one who is the lion in the circus, but the one who is the lion in G464. Auf!
